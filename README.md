<h1>Introduction</h1>

+ Atithi Devo Bhava is a platform designed to solve the common problems faced by solo travelers, such as the need for local guidance and managing high travel expenses. It connects solo travelers (Guests) with local hosts, allowing them to explore new places while gaining an authentic cultural experience.

### Target Audience:

+ Guests (Solo Travelers): Those who want to travel alone but seek local companionship for city exploration and cultural exchange.
+ Hosts: People who own homes or properties and are open to hosting travelers, especially those who are away from their families and are interested in meeting new people.

### Key Features:

+ Guest & Host Interaction:

Solo travelers can create an account and post on the feed, sharing their travel plans (e.g., city and dates).
Local hosts in that city can contact the travelers through the platform, chat with them, and verify if they’re comfortable inviting them into their homes.

+ Cultural Exchange & Exploration:

Once connected, the guest and host explore the city together, share meals, and experience the culture as friends.

+ Cost-Effective Travel:

  + Solo travelers benefit by getting free accommodation and local support.
  + Hosts benefit by overcoming loneliness and making new friends from different cultures.

Note: There’s flexibility for the host to discuss payments if needed, but the platform doesn’t enforce any payment structure—it's purely up to the individuals.

#### Problem Solved:
+ For Solo Travelers: The platform provides a trusted local contact, reducing the fear of navigating new places alone, and offers free or affordable accommodation.
+ For Hosts: It helps hosts who are away from their families or feeling lonely, giving them an opportunity to engage with new people, learn about other cultures, and build friendships.

#### Tech Stack:
+ Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS with EJS templating for dynamic content rendering.
+ Backend: Express.js for server-side logic.
+ Database: MongoDB to store user data, travel details, and interactions.
+ Cloudinary: Used for storing and managing user-uploaded images, ensuring seamless image handling.

### Why It's Unique:
Atithi Devo Bhava stands out by focusing not only on solo travelers but also on providing an enriching cultural exchange experience. It creates a win-win scenario for both travelers and hosts, encouraging genuine human connections rather than purely commercial transactions.
